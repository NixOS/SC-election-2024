### Conflict of interest disclosure

I don't have conflict of interest as of today, as I work with
Nix/Nixpkgs/NixOS only on private projects, and on my personal laptop.

### Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

I feel that our community has great values and motivations, and very
competent community members, but I feel that our priorities are not
ordered properly, and the priorities themselves could be better
communicated.

#### What I have done

You can see my PRs involvement in this link:

https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pulls?q=involves%3Adoronbehar

I think what stands out with me is fast, and accurate communication
skills. Another thing I do which I see almost nobody else doing, related
to communication is giving timeout for people to respond to changes. A
good example of this kind of behavior of mine is available here:

https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/225051#pullrequestreview-2231484654

#### What I'll do

I'd like to encourage better communication habits in the community, and
encourage the community to adopt policies regarding non-communicative
community members, and thus to help lower the amount of stale PRs.

In addition, I'd like to steer the community's efforts to prioritize:

- Improve documentation text, that also communicates current, on-going,
  WIP processes (see these comments on discourse:
   * https://discourse.nixos.org/t/documenting-bugs-and-interfaces-worth-improving-in-nixpkgs-and-nixos/30884
   * https://discourse.nixos.org/t/several-comments-about-priorities-and-new-policies-in-the-python-ecosystem/51790/13?u=doronbehar
- Structured documentation: It is very unfortunate how [this
  effort](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/108063) gets no
  attention now... I view the situation of our documentation is
  another lack of communication, which I want to improve further.
## Q&A

### What are your thoughs about eventually merging core with Guix? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/116))


Guix and Nix have a lot in common. Both have a base dir store (/{gnu,nix}/store), both have those drv files that basically run a command with args and env vars in a restricted environment.

It seems natural, at least for me, that in some way both can have a common project and basically a different stdenv and abstractions over it. Maybe the daemon and store parts could be shared and each project would only have it's own evaluator and nixpkgs and users could use Guix to use the same infrastructure Nix would use to build and remote build stuff.

What are your thoughs about eventually uniting this core in a common project?

<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/116#issuecomment-2395479001">link</a>)</summary>

I agree with what the others said that this is a nice-to-have goal that should not be prioritized, as our other issues are much more pressing. However I completely endorse ~~sharing~~ copying from them the binary seed and in general their bootstrap method, something that had a lot of progress in the last year thanks to [work by `@emilytrau`](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/227914). I don't know exactly what is the state of these efforts at the moment, but it proves the point that forks have a positive influence on the project that they were forked from.

### What are your thoughs about bringing Grafts to Nix? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/115))


Grafts are a way from Guix to bring fixes to packages that a lot of other packages depend on without having to rebuild the world basically.

What are your thoughs about bringing a equivalent feature to Nix?

### What do you believe is the most pressing technical issue facing Nix, and how will you address it? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/16))


What do you believe is the most pressing technical issue currently facing Nix, and how would you prioritize addressing it to ensure the continued stability and advancement of the ecosystem?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/16#issuecomment-2395389638">link</a>)</summary>

> While it is not the role of the SC to make the specific technical decisions, I have an interest in improving the build infrastructure, the cache, and stabilizing experimental-features.

I sort of agree with that, but I'd say that I view the role of the SC as the team in charge of prioritizing at least which general technical decisions we should take. The technical issues I find the most pressing, are (ordered):

1. [Finding resolution for our S3 binary cache situation](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nixos-s3-long-term-resolution-phase-1/36493/1).
2. GSoC idea: [Nixpkgs analytics: nixpkgs-review with a time-budget](https://github.com/NixOS/GSoC/blob/main/ideas/2024.md#nixpkgs-analytics-nixpkgs-review-with-a-time-budget)
3. GSoC idea: [outpath cache for faster automation](https://github.com/NixOS/GSoC/blob/main/ideas/2024.md#outpath-cache-for-faster-automation)
4. Structured Documentation (see [this effort](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/108063)).

<summary>What's the best way for the steering committee to deal with inaction or being ignored? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/114">link</a>)</summary>

One of the main ways in which the previous Nix governance has been criticized is for ignoring or being inactive in the face of community protests and concerns.[^1]

[^1]: I'm not interested in rehashing or re-litigating these specific cases or people involved; please do not do so in your answer.

Let's suppose that the steering committee is now responsive to the community... but when the steering committee asks for or directs action, that request is **ignored**, **de-prioritized**, or **litigated** by the relevant parties.

How would you as a single SC member deal with this? How would you ask for your fellow steering committee members to act as a group?

<summary>What is your plan on improving the darwin PR situtation? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/97">link</a>)</summary>

Right now ofborg often takes days to complete package builds for the darwin arches and it is unviable as a reviewer to wait for them to complete as they might never complete or just time out, so darwin builds are often with a bit of luck. Also if they fail, people are often clueless on how to fix the compiler/linker issues.

Question https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/109 by @iFreilicht brought up this topic, and I thought it was worth discussing on its own, because it is quite a nuanced topic.

<summary>What your thoughs about a NixOS-like thing for clusters? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/117">link</a>)</summary>

A issue I see with NixOS is that NixOS servers treat machines as pets, which is often normal and desired, but limits the potential to use Nix in clusters or grids of machines. Yeah, there are ways like using NixOS as a platform to run some clustering software such as Nomad or Kubernetes but then you lose most of the cool stuff NixOS has. One can still build the stuff that will be run with Nix to OCI containers but would need to manage and define services using some form of YAML, or HCL. Nix already has stuff for incremental copying of artifacts using nix-copy-closure and binary caches but this is lost when you have to build a OCI container each time you iterate in a service to be run.

BTW systemd has already lots of primitives to be used for this. I think the biggest challenge here would be to unify networking between services.

<summary>What are your thoughs about integrating distributed stores into Nix? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/113">link</a>)</summary>

AFAIK the most well known implementation is ipfs-nix from Obsidian systems that aim to integrate IPFS into Nix.

I, at least in the current state, am a bit skeptical about how the adoption would be. A full bump of my system would pull 10s of GBs of small artifacts, and if you have ever downloaded the closure of LaTeX packages you realized that lots of small operations == slow. I tried myself to make a RFC around exposing IPFS-compatible hashes in a narinfo so users could alternatively use IPFS to download stuff from binary caches but I basically abandoned the idea because I, myself, didn't think it would make much sense. The process would be so slow + the overhead of having to have stuff both in the nix store and IPFS store. I would only use something like this if I wouldn't need to duplicate stuff.

<summary>Financial support for maintainers (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/108">link</a>)</summary>

Many (though not all) contributors to and maintainers of the nix ecosystem are doing so as unpaid volunteer work next to their fulltime jobs. This is not sustainable, we either need more maintainers, or we need to lower the workload of the ones we have.

One way of doing this would be to sponsor them so they can switch to part-time positions or outright quit their jobs and work on Nix or nixpkgs full-time, potentially with money the foundation already receives in donations.
