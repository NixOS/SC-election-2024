### Conflict of interest disclosure

I'm an employee of [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev), a company that develops a product with a paid feature that utilizes Nix(pkgs).

### Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

#### What I have done

##### Technical

- I've been a Nixpkgs maintainer [since 2021](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/111690), and a Nixpkgs committer [since 2022](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/50105#issuecomment-1174474112).
- I wrote/maintain [`buildNpmPackage` and the associated "next generation" of npm/Node.js build tooling](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/189539).
- I [maintain the Rust build tooling](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Awinterqt+label%3A%226.topic%3A+rust%22+).
- [142 PRs created](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Awinterqt), [560 PRs reviewed](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+reviewed-by%3Awinterqt+).

##### Community

- I frequently help people on [Discourse](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/winter) and Matrix. (I mainly help users on Discourse, and fellow Nixpkgs maintainers on Matrix.)
- I've created [one RFC](https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/131), which ultimately failed to gain a suitable number of shepherds. However, its opening has had a noticeable impact on Nixpkgs as a whole, leading lots of packages to be gradually converted to using SRI hashes even in the abscence of a formal guideline.

#### What I'll do

*These are my personal "campaign goals." Note that these are just things I am passionate about and want to start having conversations about -- these **are not** guarantees.*

- **Consistency, consistency, consistency**: Lots of "standards," review comments, and nits do not follow any sort of consistency. I frequently see contributors and maintainers complaining about how inconsistent our review process is. While this is not an issue that can be just solved with an RFC or two, I hope to make headway in creating comprehensive contributing guidelines that reviewers can point to for contentious issues.
- **More automated checks and enforcement of technical standards for Nixpkgs changes**: While `nixpkgs-vet` and our other CI checks are a great start, I think we need to have an extensible framework and process to create new lints, going off the above.
- **Make it easier to feel heard about issues**: As someone who has tried to push for change in both technical and community-related capacities (e.g. as RFCs, or as pleas to the few with power within our fragmented organization), I frequently feel like the processes for some changes have a very high barrier for entry, or just don't work at all. As a member of the SC, I'll work to make it easier for people to voice their concerns and propose changes, hopefully without indefinitely devolving into bikeshedding.

#### Why should you vote for me?

I believe that, as of 2024, Nixpkgs/NixOS is *the* best way to deploy development environments, servers, and any other sort of software configuration. In light of these recent governance issues, I have evaluated other options, and I've come to the conclusion that no other solution comes close to what we've achieved as a community. (Not even Guix!)

I want to try one last time to make a difference in a community that I've loved being involved in for the past (almost) four years. As briefly mentioned before, I've poured lots of energy into trying to fix various issues, to the point where it completely burned me out from interacting with the project. I believe that, if this governance model succeeds (and I think it has a good chance of doing so), that we can make the state of affairs better than they've ever been.

## Q&A

### Should Nix transition away from GitHub to a self-hosted git forge? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/18))


Do you believe Nix should move away from GitHub and instead host its independent Git forge? If so, what are the benefits and challenges of such a transition, and how would you approach this shift if it were to happen?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/18#issuecomment-2395746479">link</a>)</summary>

I think it makes sense for some reasons (e.g. things like the platform sporadically failing/being opaque in ways we can't debug, like notifications not working), but I'm not entirely sure that self-hosted alternatives will scale too well at Nixpkgs' repo size.

Losing the network effect is both a bad thing and a good thing IMO; on one hand, we lose contributors, but on the other hand, raising the barrier to entry for contributions *might* lead to better patch quality overall. However, there are other ways to solve this problem, like automating patch vetting + having consistent contribution guidelines.
</details>

### Should Nix self-host the binary cache? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/19))


Do you believe that Nix should transition to self-hosting the binary cache on bare-metal hardware, rather than relying on third-party services for hosting its cache?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/19#issuecomment-2395765180">link</a>)</summary>

I don't have much to add, but I agree with @yu-re-ka and @roberth's takes. It's doable, but takes planning and good execution to be done well. I know we'll be able to do it eventually with time, though.

### Should `nix-community` fall under formal governance? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/11))


Do you believe that the nix-community should be managed under the formal governance? If so, how would you propose integrating community management with governance?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/11#issuecomment-2395866325">link</a>)</summary>

At this time, no. The environment lets projects/infra move a lot quicker than third-party [0] things can, which is something we need IMO.

There are some theoretical situations I can think of where such a thing may be useful (such as moderation-related concerns), but they haven't happened yet.

[0]: Official projects = first-party, nix-community projects = second-party, in this analogy.

### What kind of relationship should unofficial spaces (Reddit, Discord) have to the community and Foundation? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/34))


What kind of relationship should unofficial spaces (Reddit, Discord) have to the community? Should they be linked on the homepage? If so, should they be compelled to comply with the Foundation's code of conduct? Should we attempt to convert these communities into official spaces (if so, at what point)?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/34#issuecomment-2395872877">link</a>)</summary>

I'm going to be echoing some points here, but it's an important topic; I'd like to make my stance clear.

> What kind of relationship should unofficial spaces (Reddit, Discord) have to the community?

They should remain unofficial, unless/until they'd like that to change.

> Should they be linked on the homepage? If so, should they be compelled to comply with the Foundation's code of conduct?

Yes, and yes, IMO. However, I also wouldn't use the word "compelled" to describe this; I align with @getchoo's wording here.

> Should we attempt to convert these communities into official spaces (if so, at what point)?

See the first part of my answer.

### What is your plan on improving the darwin PR situtation? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/97))


Right now ofborg often takes days to complete package builds for the darwin arches and it is unviable as a reviewer to wait for them to complete as they might never complete or just time out, so darwin builds are often with a bit of luck. Also if they fail, people are often clueless on how to fix the compiler/linker issues.

What are your ideas for that? Should darwin be demoted to tier 3? Should we try to find sponsors for new hardware?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/97#issuecomment-2395751268">link</a>)</summary>

> Should darwin be demoted to tier 3?

Absolutely not. macOS support in Nixpkgs brings us a lot of users.

Lots of the problems you speak are pretty easy to fix (with the darwin-maintainers team a ping away), and most of these issues will go away with [Randy's SDK rework](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/346043) and [the default SDK version bump for `x86_64-darwin`](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/338695) (though the latter is for 25.05). macOS support is about to be in a very, very good place. :)

> Should we try to find sponsors for new hardware?

Yes! However, do keep in mind that OfBorg *is not* ran by the foundation/the infra team at the moment; we would ideally want to fix this eventually, so that we can make these changes much easier than is currently possible.

### Do you believe that one of the core principles of NixOS is its declarative approach?  ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/9))


If so, should NixOS strive to further minimize state and enhance its declarativity in the future? 

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/9#issuecomment-2395869982">link</a>)</summary>

Yes to both (where it make sense), plain and simple; it's what we're all here for, after all.
</details>

### What are your thoughs about bringing Grafts to Nix? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/115))


Grafts are a way from Guix to bring fixes to packages that a lot of other packages depend on without having to rebuild the world basically.

What are your thoughs about bringing a equivalent feature to Nix?

[1] https://guix.gnu.org/blog/2020/grafts-continued/

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/115#issuecomment-2395864844">link</a>)</summary>

I'm a big fan of Guix's ideas around UX/DX in general (despite implying the opposite in my candidacy doc ;)), and I think grafts would be a good thing to have. I've napkin-sketched some ideas for an implementation of them before, but it never really got off the ground. I would love for this to be done eventually.
</details>

### Experience ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/104))


What experience do you have with being responsible for making headline decisions about software used and depended upon by thousands of people? How many years have you held (or did you hold) that (or those) position(s) of responsibility?

(‘Depended upon’ is an important part of this question; a computer game might be played by thousands but of course that's nowhere near the same level of responsibility as making decisions about the Nix projects.)

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/104#issuecomment-2395869116">link</a>)</summary>

I do not and have not ever held any similar positions in OSS software, but I am also familiar with large/consequential decision making.

### Which candidates would you like to work with on the Steering Committee? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/101))


If elected to the Steering Committee, which other candidates would you prefer to work with, and why?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/101#issuecomment-2383459960">link</a>)</summary>

Question for the question: what is asking this supposed to accomplish?

The SC membership is not made based on people other SC members want to work with; whoever gets elected will hopefully learn to trust the judgement of any members they may have any reserves about.

<summary>What's the best way for the steering committee to deal with inaction or being ignored? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/114">link</a>)</summary>

One of the main ways in which the previous Nix governance has been criticized is for ignoring or being inactive in the face of community protests and concerns.[^1]

[^1]: I'm not interested in rehashing or re-litigating these specific cases or people involved; please do not do so in your answer.

Let's suppose that the steering committee is now responsive to the community... but when the steering committee asks for or directs action, that request is **ignored**, **de-prioritized**, or **litigated** by the relevant parties.

How would you as a single SC member deal with this? How would you ask for your fellow steering committee members to act as a group?

<summary>What are your thoughs about eventually merging core with Guix? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/116">link</a>)</summary>

Guix and Nix have a lot in common. Both have a base dir store (/{gnu,nix}/store), both have those drv files that basically run a command with args and env vars in a restricted environment.

It seems natural, at least for me, that in some way both can have a common project and basically a different stdenv and abstractions over it. Maybe the daemon and store parts could be shared and each project would only have it's own evaluator and nixpkgs and users could use Guix to use the same infrastructure Nix would use to build and remote build stuff.

<summary>Actions on ecosystem fragmentation? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/89">link</a>)</summary>

There's a perception that the NixOS ecosystem is becoming increasingly fragmented, whether due to governance disagreements, technical divergences, or experimentation with new approaches.

Practical solutions to end the frustration would (and will) take the entire community participation. How can you, as a lead, help both to accommodate all the opinions and to speed the adoption of solutions, taking down the number while caring about the health (consider burnout) of those involved on applying those measures?

<summary>What your thoughs about a NixOS-like thing for clusters? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/117">link</a>)</summary>

A issue I see with NixOS is that NixOS servers treat machines as pets, which is often normal and desired, but limits the potential to use Nix in clusters or grids of machines. Yeah, there are ways like using NixOS as a platform to run some clustering software such as Nomad or Kubernetes but then you lose most of the cool stuff NixOS has. One can still build the stuff that will be run with Nix to OCI containers but would need to manage and define services using some form of YAML, or HCL. Nix already has stuff for incremental copying of artifacts using nix-copy-closure and binary caches but this is lost when you have to build a OCI container each time you iterate in a service to be run.

BTW systemd has already lots of primitives to be used for this. I think the biggest challenge here would be to unify networking between services.

<summary>What are your thoughs about integrating distributed stores into Nix? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/113">link</a>)</summary>

AFAIK the most well known implementation is ipfs-nix from Obsidian systems that aim to integrate IPFS into Nix.

I, at least in the current state, am a bit skeptical about how the adoption would be. A full bump of my system would pull 10s of GBs of small artifacts, and if you have ever downloaded the closure of LaTeX packages you realized that lots of small operations == slow. I tried myself to make a RFC around exposing IPFS-compatible hashes in a narinfo so users could alternatively use IPFS to download stuff from binary caches but I basically abandoned the idea because I, myself, didn't think it would make much sense. The process would be so slow + the overhead of having to have stuff both in the nix store and IPFS store. I would only use something like this if I wouldn't need to duplicate stuff.

Many (though not all) contributors to and maintainers of the nix ecosystem are doing so as unpaid volunteer work next to their fulltime jobs. This is not sustainable, we either need more maintainers, or we need to lower the workload of the ones we have.

One way of doing this would be to sponsor them so they can switch to part-time positions or outright quit their jobs and work on Nix or nixpkgs full-time, potentially with money the foundation already receives in donations.
