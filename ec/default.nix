        Hello, @@GITHUB_LOGIN@

        As a first step towards a better governance for official Nix projects,
        we are happy to announce the kick-off of the [first Nix Steering Committee election][repo]!

        [repo]: ${repo}

        The Steering Committee will be the primary community leadership body, responsible for steering the official Nix projects --
        organisationally, socially, and technically.
        This includes making decisions over what is official, managing teams,
        approving NixOS Foundation policies relevant for the community,
        being the final escalation point, and more as [detailed in the Nix Governance Constitution][constitution].

        [constitution]: https://github.com/NixOS/nix-constitutional-assembly/blob/main/constitution.md#steering-committee

        While the Steering Committee is given the authority to make decisions within the scope of its responsibilities directly,
        it is expected to delegate as much as possible.

        We will send a reminder to vote on 2024-10-18 Fri.

        ### The Candidates

        Please inform yourself about the candidates by looking at their
        [candidate info documents][candidates], which include:

        [candidates]: https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/tree/main/candidates

        - Basic contact info
        - A conflict of interest disclosure
        - A statement on their motivation to be on the Steering Committee
        - All Q&A questions answered by the candidate, followed by ones not answered

        Each candidate's individual info document is also linked on the ballot.

        ### How to vote

        To be able to vote, you need to activate your email in the
        [`voters.json` file][voters]
        with CIVS by following the steps on the
        [CIVS Activate User page](https://civs1.civs.us/cgi-bin/opt_in.pl).

        If you already did so, you should've already received an email
        from <civs@cornell.edu> with a link to the poll.

        If you're only activating your email now, you will get a link to
        the poll in the activation page under "Pending poll invitations".
        If you missed this, you can go through the email activation again.

        If you have a question, please contact the [Election Committee][ec].

        Unfortunately the CIVS poll we used for the election got corrupted
        due to technical issues out of our control.
        A symptom of the problem is that the system appears to
        allow voters to vote multiple times.
        As such we are invalidating the existing poll,
        please hold off voting for a new future poll instead.
        Already submitted ballots appear to be irrecoverable.
        We apologise for the inconvenience.

        According to the CIVS admin,
        a data corruption like that has never been seen before.
        The [CIVS FAQ][faq][^1] implies this to be
        first time data has been lost since 2006.
        As far as we understand, the Berkley DB files got corrupted
        in such a way that at least the table of the voters who have voted
        is not handled correctly anymore.

        [faq]: https://civs1.civs.us/faq.html
        [^1]: [Archive link](http://web.archive.org/web/20240926133351/https://civs1.civs.us/faq.html)

        We have no insight into the CIVS server,
        but are in contact with the admin to try figure out
        what went went wrong in more detail and how to best proceed.
        We will follow up with another announcement no later than this Friday.

        ## Email updates possible again for now

        As a consequence of the above,
        we can again allow email updates until the new poll is started.
        To do so, follow [these steps][email].

        [email]: ${p ../doc/email.md}

        ## The candidates

        You can also still prepare yourself to vote by looking at the [candidates].

        [candidates]: ${p ../candidates}
      '';
  };

    title = throw "unused";
    announcement =

        Because we don't have sufficient confidence in the CIVS problem not reoccurring again, we have decided to use [OpaVote](https://opavote.com/) to collect the ballots instead. We're still going to use CIVS tallying of the results, so that they won't get influenced based on how ballots are collected. Note that OpaVote (like CIVS) allows the voters to get an anonymised list of all the ballots cast, and we will enable this after the election.

        Unlike CIVS, OpaVote doesn't require a separate activation step for emails, so all eligible voters with email addresses considered valid will be sent emails with the voting link from <noreply@opavote.com>, as well as voting reminders every 3 days.

        **You must cast your vote by 2024-11-03 23:59:59 Sun** in [Anywhere on Earth time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth), meaning as long as it is still the given day anywhere on the planet (i.e. at the end of that day in UTC-12). After the poll is closed, votes will not be accepted for any reason.

        _Note that, unlike CIVS, OpaVote **does not** allow to correct your ballot once cast! Furthermore, you cannot rank two candidates the same, except for unranked candidates. We will treat all the unranked candidates as tied for the last place when tallying._

        ## Removed email addresses and how to set them

        Because [OpaVote's terms](https://opavote.com/terms) has potential sanctions for undeliverable emails and doesn't have a separate email activation step like CIVS, we have [removed](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/commit/928be359ebbabc7ddad1457e0a63981695247685) some voter email addresses that couldn't be reached.

        We cannot change the voter emails where the voting link has been delivered, but for missing and bouncing addresses, users can still [update their email address](https://github.com/nix-constitutional-assembly-2024/SC-election-2024/blob/main/doc/email.md). Everybody without an email address in `voters.json` will be notified once more.
